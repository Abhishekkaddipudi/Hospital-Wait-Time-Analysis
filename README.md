# Hospital Data Analysis with Power BI: Wait Time Project

## Overview

This Power BI project focuses on analyzing hospital data to understand and optimize wait times for patients. The goal is to provide insights into the factors affecting wait times, identify trends, and propose recommendations for improving the overall efficiency of the hospital's patient flow.

## Project Structure

### 1. Data Source

- The project utilizes a comprehensive dataset from [source], containing information on patient arrivals, check-in times, and service durations.

### 2. Data Preparation

- Data cleaning and preprocessing steps were performed using Power Query to handle missing values, standardize formats, and create relevant calculated columns.

### 3. Data Modeling

- The data was modeled to establish relationships between different tables, enabling seamless exploration and analysis in Power BI.

### 4. Analysis and Visualization

- Various Power BI visualizations such as bar charts, line charts, and heatmaps were employed to analyze wait times across different departments, shifts, and days of the week.
- Key performance indicators (KPIs) were defined to measure and monitor wait time metrics.

### 5. Insights and Findings

- Insights were derived from the analysis, highlighting peak hours, bottleneck departments, and potential areas for improvement.
- Anomalies or outliers in wait times were identified and investigated.
